<p className="lead">Just last week, I fulfilled a long standing dream of mine: I participated in a game jam. [React Jam](https://reactjam.com/) may not be the most prestigious out there, but as I'm *kind of* good with React it was easy for me to create and finish something.</p>

I started in the jam without any intent of winning one of the challenges. But as jams go, I *was* in it to try something new and so I decided that I would follow the rules of both challenges. That meant creating a game running on the [Rune](https://www.rune.ai/) platform, the jams sponsor.

## **Good:** Everybodys tech stack

## **Weird:** The Rune SDK

Generally, I like the idea of Rune. It's a platform for multiplayer games that handles stuff like user accounts, friend lists and voice chat. It's still kind of new-ish so we will see if they can actually keep all their developer friendly promises, but right now everything about Rune seems nice.

The SDK is basically just an elaborate state handler. I define what my game state looks like and then define some actions to transform that game state. On the client, my renderer has to react to changes in the game state and my call actions to change the game state. The framework then executes the action on my client for fast response times while simultanieously sending the action to the server where it is checked against the server logic. When the server says the action is okay it's forwarded to all the other clients. When the server can not confirm the action my client has to roll back.

That's not exactly elaborate netcode, but for many use cases this gets the job done just fine. I'm not creating a fighting game after all, so nobody will scream at me for not doing rollbacks, doing too much rollbacks or doing rollbacks wrong. I have know next to nothing about netcode and even less about fighting games, but everybody seems to be angry about rollbacks all the time. Anyway, the Rune SDK frees me from writing all the necessary boilerplate for state synchronization myself.

Still, all in all, I find the SDK and platform to still be a bit lacking. My smaller complaint is that I have to write everything into a single logic file. That's right, a single file for everything except rendering. The whole game logic. I get why this is necessary to not complicate things on the server too much, and there's ways around that, but why isn't this already a thing in their official project scaffolding tool?

My much bigger complaint is how the platform currently only supports a small number of types of games (if you care about people not cheating in your games). The game state synchronization always synchronizes the whole game state across all of the clients. So there's just no place to store hidden information in a secure way.

I made a game about hidden roles and the roles are just ... there. Your browser receives the roles of everybody else and if you know where to look you can just do so. And that's extra bad considering that everything about Rune just *screams* board game and most board games have hidden information. Looking at the [BoardGameGeek Top 50](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) the only game I can confidently say could be created on Rune is *7 Wonders Duel* (To be fair, I didn't play them all yet and it's been a while for a few of them - I think *Barrage* had a stack of cards?)
